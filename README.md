# SRAM
SRAM Design using 45nm technology

Full Array shows the block diagram which includes 16 SRAM cells, Read, Write circuitry

Read_butterfly.m and write.m are the matlab files used plot butterfly curv of the obtained data to determine read margin and write margin of the design.

Project report shows all the results including the layout of complete design
